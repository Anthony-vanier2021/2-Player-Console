*Possible Future Plans*

- Adding individual limits to the controllers and setting them via a new function to take into account different joystick calibrations
- Adding more directions to js_dir and get_dir
- Checking to see if joystick pins have been changed from 0,0,0
- Controller constructor with Joystick parameter 
- Check if button was PRESSED function
- Make Game class
  - Making macros to access player controllers directly
